# Predicting Credit Risk Using Machine Learning Models

- To forecast whether a loan from Lending Club will become high risk or not, this machine learning model is developed on a peer-to-peer lending platform that allows investors to partially fund personal loans as well as purchase and sell the notes that back the loans on a secondary market.  

- We utilised 'StandardScaler' to scale the training and testing sets in this project Re-fitting the LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier models on the scaled data.
- Use a confusion matrix and a heat map to plot the matrix to confirm the model's performance! 
## Dataset

- Retrieve the data

[GenerateData.ipynb](/Resources/Generator/GenerateData.ipynb) notebook that will download data from LendingClub and output two CSVs: 

* `2019loans.csv`
* `2020Q1loans.csv`

## Lessons Learned

- Machine learning is ideal for solving difficult issues that lack an algorithmic solution.
